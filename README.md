## How does the program work

This OpenGL-based application showcases fundamental 3D graphics techniques, providing an immersive scene with Phong lighting, basic textures, skybox, and interactive controls:<br>

Basic Lighting: Implements the Phong lighting model, creating lifelike interactions between light and objects through ambient, diffuse, and specular reflections.<br>

Basic textures: Apply detailed images to the surface of a 3D model with texture mapping, enhancing its appearance with details such as color, pattern, and material properties.<br>

Skybox: Uses a cubemap to render a surrounding environment, offering a distant background that adds depth and immersion to the 3D space.<br>

Mouse and Keyboard Controls: The user can control the movement by moving the angle of view with the mouse, WASD, and T and F can control the switch of light.<br>
